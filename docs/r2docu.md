# r2docu (WIP)

## Welcome
This documentation is aimed to be a quick and easy-to-follow first contact to radare2 (r2) so you can have it installed and start using it in few minutes.

It is not meant to replace the comprehensive guides and explanations from the r2book neither a full reference of every single feature, but a place where newcomers can feel and put in practice the r2 power from the very beginning.

### What is radare2
In a nutshell, r2 is a free and open source reverse engineering framework built from scratch in C without any third-party dependency that runs on very major (and many others) [platforms] and has native support for a lot of [file formats]. It can be used as is or you can built your own tools on top of r2 using your favourite scripting language.

### What can radare2 do
At a first glance, here you are a non-exhaustive list of things that r2 can be useful for:
- Disassemble binaries of several [architectures] and [operating systems]
- Analyze code, data, references and structures
- Binary manipulation, code injection, patching, bindiffing
- Mount filesystems, detect partitions, carve for data
- Extract information and metrics that can be used for binary classification
- Kernel analysis and debugging

## Installation
The recommended way to install radare2 is to get the last git version.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2
$ cd radare2
$ ./sys/install.sh # Run this to automatically pull and update
```
There also exist precompiled binaries for OS X and Windows.
Windows download: [here]
OS X download: [here]

You can also build it by yourself. Check [build instructions] for different platforms.


## Quick start
<!--- merge with below somehow? --->
You can follow step-by-step the following commands.

### Open a file
```
$ r2 /bin/ls
```
(You can prefix `-w` for opening in write mode or `-d` for opening in debug mode)

### Basic commands
Commands in r2 follow simple mnemonic rules.

`s` -> **s**eek [to (relative) address]
```
[0x00005850]> s 0x10
[0x00000010]> s 0
[0x00000000]> s 0x5850
[0x00005850]> s + 0x100
[0x00005950]>
```

`px` -> **p**rint he**x**dump [number of bytes]
```
[0x00005850]> px 64
- offset -   0 1  2 3  4 5  6 7  8 9  A B  C D  E F  0123456789ABCDEF
0x00005850  31ed 4989 d15e 4889 e248 83e4 f050 544c  1.I..^H..H...PTL
0x00005860  8d05 ca0a 0100 488d 0d53 0a01 0048 8d3d  ......H..S...H.=
0x00005870  1ce6 ffff ff15 5ea7 2100 f40f 1f44 0000  ......^.!....D..
0x00005880  488d 3de1 a921 0055 488d 05d9 a921 0048  H.=..!.UH....!.H
[0x00005850]>
```

`pd` -> **p**rint **d**isassembly [number of instructions]
```
[0x00005850]> pd 5
            0x00005850      31ed           xor ebp, ebp
            0x00005852      4989d1         mov r9, rdx
            0x00005855      5e             pop rsi
            0x00005856      4889e2         mov rdx, rsp
            0x00005859      4883e4f0       and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0
[0x00005850]>
```

`q` -> **q**uit
```
[0x00005850]> q
$
```

Now we will have to open the file with write access. As we don't want to mess with system binary, let's make a copy before.

```
$ cp /bin/ls /tmp/ls
$ r2 /tmp/ls
```

`wx` -> **w**rite he**x**pairs
```
[0x00005850]> px 16

`wa` -> **w**rite **a**ssembly
```

### Basic modifiers

[0x00005850]> 
```

(we have a subcommand of `pd` called `pdf` to **p**rint **d**isassembly of **f**unction that we are going to use just right now)

- Use `@` for temporary seek.
As we already ran `aa` to analyze all, we have flags for identified functions' offsets.
```

[0x00005850]>
```
As we can see, we disassembled the function seeking temporarily to its starting offset but after the disassembly we are still placed at the previous offset because of the `@` modifier.


### Handy tricks
- Many commands support appending `j` (`j~{}`) for json (indented) output
- Append `q` for quit output.
- Pipe with shell commands like in a normal shell with `|`
- Prefix with `!` to run shell commands.
- Internal grep with `~`
