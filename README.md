## Update: current status
Project is on hold. Should discuss if it can fit with new website being pushed and if it makes sense to have it separeted or try to focus on intro of official r2book which attracts way more readers. Don't expect updates anytime soon here, thus it is going to be archived.

# r2docu | Building a proper r2 beginner's documentation

The idea behind r2docu is to make radare2 as easily accessible as possible for beginners.

The final goal would be to deploy a (more) refined and final version into the (hopefully soon) update of radare2 website that is under development right now.

Any ideas, suggestions or comments to help improve r2docu as well as typos' correction and better use-of-english tips are totally welcome.
