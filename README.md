## Update: current status
Please note that r2docu is on hold until new radare2 website is ready. There is no deadline, though, so expect it to be quite quiet in the near-mid future. When new website is available, should consider if/how r2docu could fit on it.

# r2docu | Building a proper r2 beginner's documentation

The idea behind r2docu is to make radare2 as easily accessible as possible for beginners.

The final goal would be to deploy a (more) refined and final version into the (hopefully soon) update of radare2 website that is under development right now.

Any ideas, suggestions or comments to help improve r2docu as well as typos' correction and better use-of-english tips are totally welcome.
